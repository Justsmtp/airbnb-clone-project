# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Backend Project

## 🚀 Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project provides a robust and scalable foundation to manage user interactions, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. It mimics core Airbnb features and ensures a smooth experience for both users and hosts.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure user registration, authentication, and profile handling.
- **Property Management**: CRUD features for creating, updating, and retrieving listings.
- **Booking System**: Booking mechanism to manage reservations, check-ins, and check-outs.
- **Payment Processing**: Handle transactions and payment record storage.
- **Review System**: Post and manage user reviews and property ratings.
- **Data Optimization**: Efficient data retrieval using indexing and caching.

- **GraphQL**: Flexible query mechanism for frontend consumption.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users/`
  - `POST /users/`
  - `GET /users/{user_id}/`
  - `PUT /users/{user_id}/`
  - `DELETE /users/{user_id}/`

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /properties/`
  - `POST /properties/`
  - `GET /properties/{property_id}/`
  - `PUT /properties/{property_id}/`
  - `DELETE /properties/{property_id}/`

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /bookings/`
  - `POST /bookings/`
  - `GET /bookings/{booking_id}/`
  - `PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/`
  - `DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/`

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /payments/`

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /reviews/`
  - `POST /reviews/`
  - `GET /reviews/{review_id}/`
  - `PUT /reviews/{review_id}/`
  - `DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/`

### 7. Database Optimization
- **Indexing**: Speeds up retrieval for key queries.
- **Caching**: Uses Redis for reducing DB load and improving performance.

## 🗄️ Database Design

The Airbnb Clone backend consists of five primary entities. Each entity is related to others through foreign key relationships to support seamless data interaction.

---

### 📘 Entities & Relationships

---

Represents people using the platform either as guests or hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (UUID)
- `name`
- `email`

- `is_host` (Boolean)

**Relationships:**
- A **user** can **own multiple properties**
- A **user** can **make multiple bookings**
- A **user** can **leave multiple reviews**

---

### **2. Properties**
Represents rental listings created by hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`
- `host_id` (ForeignKey → Users)

**Relationships:**
