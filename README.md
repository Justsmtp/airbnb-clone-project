## 📌 Summary of REST Endpoints

## 🗄️ Database Design

The Airbnb Clone backend consists of five primary entities. Each entity is related to others through foreign key relationships to support seamless data interaction.

---

### 📘 Entities & Relationships

---

### **1. Users**
Represents people using the platform either as guests or hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (UUID)
- `name`
- `email`
- `password` (hashed)
- `is_host` (Boolean)

**Relationships:**
- A **user** can **own multiple properties**
- A **user** can **make multiple bookings**
- A **user** can **leave multiple reviews**

---

### **2. Properties**
Represents rental listings created by hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`
- `host_id` (ForeignKey → Users)

**Relationships:**
- A **property** is owned by one **user (host)**
- A **property** can have multiple **bookings**
- A **property** can have multiple **reviews**

---

### **3. Bookings**

**Key Fields:**
- `id`
- `user_id` (ForeignKey → Users)
- `property_id` (ForeignKey → Properties)

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone backend. Each feature plays a vital role in delivering a complete and functional booking platform experience.

---

### 🔐 User Management

Handles user registration, login, and profile management. It ensures secure access to the platform and distinguishes between guests and hosts through role-based controls.

---

### 🏡 Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. Each property includes details such as title, location, price, and description, enabling users to browse and find suitable accommodations.

---

### 📅 Booking System

Enables users to reserve properties for specific dates. It validates availability, handles check-in/check-out logic, and allows users to view or manage their bookings.

---

### 💳 Payment Processing

Processes payments for bookings through a secure endpoint. It tracks transaction status and ensures that payment records are tied to specific bookings, forming the financial backbone of the platform.

---

### ⭐ Review System

Allows users to leave ratings and reviews for properties they've stayed in. Reviews help maintain transparency and guide other users in choosing quality listings.

---

### ⚡ Data Optimization

Implements indexing and caching strategies to improve database performance. This ensures efficient data retrieval, especially for frequently accessed endpoints such as property searches and booking histories.

## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is essential to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain the integrity of the platform. The following security measures are implemented to safeguard the Airbnb Clone backend:

---

### 🧾 Authentication

**Description**: Implements token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to verify the identity of users accessing the API.

**Importance**: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing protected endpoints and ensures that only authenticated users can perform actions like creating bookings or listing properties.

---

### 🛂 Authorization

**Description**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to differentiate between users (guests) and hosts, ensuring each role can only access permitted resources.

**Importance**: Protects the system by restricting sensitive operations—such as property management or viewing payment details—to authorized users only.

---

### 🚦 Rate Limiting

**Description**: Limits the number of requests a client can make in a given timeframe to prevent API abuse.

**Importance**: Shields the backend from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage for all users.

---

### 🔒 Data Encryption

**Description**: All sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, is encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (in the database).

**Importance**: Safeguards user credentials and financial data from being intercepted or leaked during transmission or storage.

---

### 🧪 Input Validation & Sanitization

**Description**: Validates and sanitizes incoming request data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

**Importance**: Helps maintain data integrity and prevents malicious data from compromising the application.

---

### 🎫 Secure Payment Processing

**Description**: Payment processing endpoints require strict authentication and secure payload handling.

**Importance**: Ensures the confidentiality and integrity of transaction data and prevents fraudulent payments.
