## 🏆 Project Goals

- **User Management**: Secure user registration, authentication, and profile handling.
- **Property Management**: CRUD features for creating, updating, and retrieving listings.
- **Booking System**: Booking mechanism to manage reservations, check-ins, and check-outs.
- **Payment Processing**: Handle transactions and payment record storage.
- **Review System**: Post and manage user reviews and property ratings.
- **Data Optimization**: Efficient data retrieval using indexing and caching.

### 2. User Authentication
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users/`
  - `POST /users/`
  - `GET /users/{user_id}/`
  - `PUT /users/{user_id}/`
  - `DELETE /users/{user_id}/`

### 3. Property Management
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /properties/`
  - `POST /properties/`
  - `GET /properties/{property_id}/`
  - `PUT /properties/{property_id}/`
  - `DELETE /properties/{property_id}/`

### 4. Booking System
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /bookings/`
  - `POST /bookings/`
  - `GET /bookings/{booking_id}/`
  - `PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/`
  - `DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/`

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /payments/`

### 6. Review System
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /reviews/`
  - `POST /reviews/`
  - `GET /reviews/{review_id}/`
  - `PUT /reviews/{review_id}/`
